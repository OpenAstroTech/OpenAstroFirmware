# OpenAstroFirmware Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**All code changes MUST follow Test-Driven Development:**
- Tests are written BEFORE implementation begins
- Tests MUST fail initially (red phase)
- Implementation makes tests pass (green phase)
- Code is refactored while maintaining passing tests (refactor phase)
- No feature is considered "done" until comprehensive tests exist

**Scope of Testing:**
- **Unit tests**: Required for all parsers, validators, calculators, state machines
- **Integration tests**: Required for protocol implementations, driver interfaces, hardware abstractions
- **Simulation tests**: Required for all features using native_sim before hardware deployment
- **Hardware tests**: Required for TMC drivers, sensor integrations, motor control on target platforms

**Rationale**: Embedded firmware controlling precision telescope hardware demands absolute correctness. TDD ensures specification compliance, prevents regressions, and enables fearless refactoring. Tests serve as living documentation and design specifications.

**Enforcement**: Pull requests without corresponding tests MUST be rejected. Tests that are not failing before implementation indicate implementation-first development and MUST be rejected.

### II. Hardware Abstraction & Modularity

**All hardware dependencies MUST be abstracted through Zephyr interfaces:**
- Use Zephyr device tree for hardware configuration
- Implement platform-independent core logic in application layer (C++20)
- Implement hardware drivers using Zephyr driver APIs (C)
- All board-specific code MUST reside in `boards/` or device tree overlays
- New hardware support MUST NOT require changes to core mount control logic

**Modularity Requirements:**
- Each subsystem (LX200 protocol, mount control, stepper drivers, sensors) MUST be independently testable
- Zephyr module structure MUST be maintained with clear `zephyr/module.yml` definition
- Libraries MUST have clearly defined public interfaces in `include/` directory
- Cross-module dependencies MUST be explicit and justified

**Rationale**: OpenAstroFirmware supports multiple hardware platforms (MKS Robin Nano, Nucleo, future boards) and enables native simulation for development. Hardware abstraction allows testing without physical hardware, simplifies porting, and enables community hardware contributions without disrupting core functionality.

**Enforcement**: Code reviews MUST verify hardware dependencies are properly abstracted. Native simulation MUST pass before hardware testing begins.

### III. Real-Time Performance Requirements

**All real-time operations MUST meet strict timing guarantees:**
- LX200 command responses: ≤100ms (REQ-PERF-002)
- Tracking precision: sub-arcsecond accuracy (REQ-PERF-001)
- Guiding corrections: millisecond timing accuracy (REQ-PERF-003)
- Tracking continuity: no interruptions during concurrent operations (REQ-PERF-004)

**Performance Implementation Standards:**
- Use Zephyr RTOS deterministic scheduling for time-critical operations
- Stepper motor timing MUST use nanosecond-precision intervals (REQ-STEP-014)
- Asynchronous operations MUST NOT block real-time control loops (REQ-STEP-004)
- Memory allocations MUST respect embedded platform constraints (REQ-PERF-005)

**Performance Validation:**
- All timing-critical code paths MUST be profiled and documented
- Performance regression tests MUST be run on target hardware
- CPU utilization MUST be monitored and kept within acceptable limits (REQ-PERF-006)

**Rationale**: Telescope tracking requires real-time precision. Missing timing deadlines results in star trailing, failed astrophotography, and loss of tracking accuracy. Real-time guarantees are non-negotiable for astronomical applications.

**Enforcement**: Performance benchmarks MUST be established for timing-critical operations. Pull requests affecting control loops MUST include performance measurements from hardware testing.

### IV. Code Quality & Standards

**All code MUST adhere to language-specific best practices:**

**C++20 Application Layer Standards:**
- Modern C++20 idioms (structured bindings, concepts, ranges where appropriate)
- RAII for resource management (no manual memory management)
- Prefer `constexpr` for compile-time computation
- Use Zephyr logging framework (`LOG_MODULE_REGISTER`)
- Class-based design for mount control, state management

**C Driver/Protocol Layer Standards:**
- Follow Zephyr coding conventions for drivers
- Use Zephyr device API patterns
- Clear error handling with result types (e.g., `lx200_parse_result_t`)
- No dynamic memory allocation in interrupt contexts
- Structured logging with appropriate log levels

**Universal Requirements:**
- Meaningful variable/function names reflecting domain concepts (RA, DEC, tracking, guiding)
- Comprehensive comments for complex algorithms (coordinate transformations, tracking calculations)
- Error handling at all external boundaries (serial input, hardware drivers)
- Static analysis warnings MUST be addressed or explicitly justified

**Rationale**: High code quality reduces bugs, improves maintainability, and facilitates community contributions. Embedded systems require particular attention to resource management and error handling.

**Enforcement**: Automated linting and formatting checks in CI/CD pipeline. Code reviews MUST verify adherence to standards before merging.

### V. User Experience Consistency

**All user-facing interfaces MUST provide consistent, reliable experiences:**

**LX200 Protocol Compliance:**
- Strict adherence to Meade LX200 command specification
- Consistent response formats (coordinate precision modes, error codes)
- Predictable command behavior across all supported features
- Comprehensive protocol test coverage (all command families)

**Software Integration:**
- MUST be compatible with ASCOM, INDI, N.I.N.A., SkySafari (REQ-COMPAT-001 to REQ-COMPAT-005)
- Command responses MUST match expected formats for third-party software
- Error conditions MUST be communicated clearly to control software

**Firmware Updates & Configuration:**
- Clear documentation for installation and update procedures (REQ-UX-001)
- User-friendly update tools for non-technical users (REQ-UX-002)
- Progress feedback during updates (REQ-UX-003)
- Graceful error handling with recovery procedures (REQ-UX-004)
- Configuration preservation during updates (REQ-FW-UPDATE-006)

**Web Interface (when WiFi enabled):**
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile browsers (REQ-WEB-002)
- Intuitive configuration workflows (REQ-WEB-003)
- Real-time status monitoring (REQ-WEB-004)
- Secure authentication (REQ-WEB-006)
- Configuration backup/restore (REQ-WEB-007)

**Rationale**: Telescope mount control is already complex—software must not add unnecessary friction. Consistent interfaces reduce learning curve, improve reliability of integrations, and enable users to focus on astronomy rather than troubleshooting. Many users are astronomers, not software developers.

**Enforcement**: User-facing changes MUST be tested with actual client software (ASCOM, INDI). Documentation MUST be updated alongside functionality changes. UX feedback from testing MUST be addressed before release.

## Performance Standards

**Tracking Accuracy Requirements:**
- Sidereal tracking error: <1 arcsecond over 5 minutes

**Resource Utilization Limits:**
- RAM usage: <60% of available on target platform
- CPU utilization: <70% during typical operation (tracking + guiding + commands)
- Flash usage: Leave 20% margin for future updates

**Concurrency Requirements:**
- Simultaneous RA/DEC movement without interference (REQ-PERF-007)
- Background command processing during tracking
- Sensor polling without affecting motor control timing

## Governance

**Constitutional Authority:**
This constitution supersedes all other development practices and conventions. When conflicts arise between this document and other guidance, the constitution takes precedence.

**Amendment Process:**
1. Proposed changes MUST be documented with rationale
2. Impact assessment on existing code and workflows required
3. Team review and consensus required for approval
4. Version number incremented according to semantic versioning:
   - **MAJOR**: Backward-incompatible governance changes, principle removals
   - **MINOR**: New principles added, material guidance expansions
   - **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording improvements, non-semantic refinements
5. Migration plan required for changes affecting existing code
6. All dependent templates and documentation updated within same change

**Compliance Verification:**
- All pull requests MUST be evaluated against constitutional principles
- Reviewers MUST explicitly verify TDD compliance, hardware abstraction, performance impact, code quality, and UX consistency
- Violations MUST be justified with documented rationale or changes rejected
- Complexity that conflicts with simplicity MUST demonstrate clear necessity

**Runtime Development Guidance:**
For ongoing development workflows, feature planning, and agent-specific guidance, refer to:
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot guidance
- `.specify/templates/` for feature specification, planning, and task workflows
- `specs/requirements.md` for comprehensive functional requirements
- `specs/design.md` for architectural patterns and design decisions

**Review Frequency:**
Constitution SHOULD be reviewed quarterly to ensure alignment with project evolution, emerging best practices, and community feedback.
