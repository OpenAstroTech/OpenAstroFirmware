# Development roadmap

**Description:** This document outlines a comprehensive development roadmap for OpenAstroFirmware, an open-source telescope mount control system built on Zephyr RTOS. It provides a structured, phased approach to transform the current foundational codebase into a professional-grade astronomical control platform.

**Goal:** To establish clear development priorities and timelines for implementing essential features including LX200 protocol support, mount control systems, hardware integration, and advanced astronomical capabilities, ultimately creating a competitive alternative to commercial telescope control solutions while maintaining the project's open-source and DIY-friendly nature.

## üéØ Current State Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Solid foundation with Zephyr RTOS and modern C++
- Comprehensive stepper motor driver framework (TMC22xx, TMC50xx, GPIO)
- Cross-platform development with native simulation
- Professional build system (West/CMake)
- Clear architecture separation

**Gaps:**
- LX200 protocol implementation incomplete
- Minimal Mount class with no coordinate management
- No integration between stepper drivers and mount control
- Missing calibration and homing procedures
